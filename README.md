# Python
Each project serves a different purpose, focusing on extracting, analysing, and presenting data in meaningful ways to support decision-making and insights.
- Data Analytics: using libraries such as pandas and NumPy are used to clean, manipulate, and explore data. These analyses provide valuable insights into trends, correlations, and patterns within the data.
- Data Visualisation: using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, the project visualises complex data in a way that is easy to understand. It includes charts, graphs, and interactive visualisations that help users interpret large datasets and identify key findings.
- Machine Learning: using libraries such as scikit-learn. It aims to predict outcomes, classify data, or uncover deeper insights based on historical patterns and trends.
